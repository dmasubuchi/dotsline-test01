# PlayStation Platform Integration - Conceptual Design

This document outlines the conceptual design for integrating the PlayStation gaming platform with the DotsGames ID system. While not yet implemented, this design provides a roadmap for future development.

## Overview

The PlayStation integration will allow DotsGames ID users to:

1. Link their PlayStation Network (PSN) accounts to their DotsGames ID
2. Access PlayStation-specific features and data
3. View and manage their PlayStation game library and trophies
4. Connect with their PlayStation friends through DotsGames ID

## Integration Architecture

### Authentication Flow

The PlayStation integration will use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for secure authentication:

1. **Initiation**:
   - User clicks "Link PlayStation Account" in the DotsGames ID platform linking section
   - System redirects to the PlayStation authentication page

2. **Authorization**:
   - User logs in with their PSN credentials on the Sony authentication page
   - User grants permission for DotsGames ID to access their PlayStation profile and data

3. **Token Exchange**:
   - PlayStation authentication service returns an authorization code
   - DotsGames ID backend exchanges the code for access and refresh tokens
   - Tokens are securely stored and associated with the user's DotsGames ID

4. **Profile Linking**:
   - PlayStation profile information is retrieved using the access token
   - PlayStation profile is linked to the user's DotsGames ID
   - User is redirected back to the DotsGames ID platform linking page

### API Integration

The integration will utilize the PlayStation Network API to access user data:

1. **PlayStation Network API Endpoints**:
   - `/profile` - Retrieve user profile information
   - `/games` - Access user's game library
   - `/trophies` - Get user's trophy collection
   - `/friends` - Access user's friend list
   - `/presence` - Check online status and current activity

2. **Data Synchronization**:
   - Periodic background synchronization of game library and trophies
   - Real-time updates for online status and current activity
   - On-demand synchronization when user accesses specific features

### Security Considerations

1. **Token Management**:
   - Secure storage of access and refresh tokens
   - Automatic token refresh when expired
   - Token revocation on account unlinking

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Encryption of stored PSN credentials and tokens
   - Compliance with Sony's data protection requirements
   - User consent for data access and storage

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Adherence to PlayStation Network API rate limits
   - Caching strategies to minimize API calls
   - Graceful handling of API throttling

## User Experience

### Linking Process

1. User navigates to the Platform Linking page in DotsGames ID
2. User selects PlayStation from the available platforms
3. User clicks "Link Account" button
4. User is redirected to Sony login page
5. User authenticates with their PSN credentials
6. User grants permissions for DotsGames ID to access their PlayStation data
7. User is redirected back to DotsGames ID with successful linking confirmation
