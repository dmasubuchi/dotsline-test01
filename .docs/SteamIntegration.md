# Steam Platform Integration - Conceptual Design

This document outlines the conceptual design for integrating the Steam gaming platform with the DotsGames ID system. While not yet implemented, this design provides a roadmap for future development.

## Overview

The Steam integration will allow DotsGames ID users to:

1. Link their Steam accounts to their DotsGames ID
2. Access Steam-specific features and data
3. View and manage their Steam game library and achievements
4. Connect with their Steam friends through DotsGames ID

## Integration Architecture

### Authentication Flow

The Steam integration will use the OpenID protocol for authentication, followed by Steam Web API access:

1. **Initiation**:
   - User clicks "Link Steam Account" in the DotsGames ID platform linking section
   - System redirects to the Steam OpenID authentication page

2. **Authorization**:
   - User logs in with their Steam credentials on the Steam authentication page
   - Steam authenticates the user and returns their Steam ID

3. **API Key Usage**:
   - DotsGames ID backend uses its Steam Web API key to access user data
   - Steam ID is securely stored and associated with the user's DotsGames ID

4. **Profile Linking**:
   - Steam profile information is retrieved using the Steam Web API
   - Steam profile is linked to the user's DotsGames ID
   - User is redirected back to the DotsGames ID platform linking page

### API Integration

The integration will utilize the Steam Web API to access user data:

1. **Steam Web API Endpoints**:
   - `GetPlayerSummaries` - Retrieve user profile information
   - `GetOwnedGames` - Access user's game library
   - `GetPlayerAchievements` - Get user's achievements
   - `GetFriendList` - Access user's friend list
   - `GetUserStatsForGame` - Get detailed game statistics

2. **Data Synchronization**:
   - Periodic background synchronization of game library and achievements
   - On-demand synchronization when user accesses specific features
   - Caching of Steam data to reduce API calls

### Security Considerations

1. **API Key Management**:
   - Secure storage of Steam Web API key
   - Server-side only usage of API key
   - Regular rotation of API keys

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Encryption of stored Steam IDs
   - Compliance with Valve's data protection requirements
   - User consent for data access and storage

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Adherence to Steam Web API rate limits
   - Caching strategies to minimize API calls
   - Graceful handling of API throttling

## User Experience

### Linking Process

1. User navigates to the Platform Linking page in DotsGames ID
2. User selects Steam from the available platforms
3. User clicks "Link Account" button
4. User is redirected to Steam login page
5. User authenticates with their Steam credentials
6. User is redirected back to DotsGames ID with successful linking confirmation

### Steam Features in DotsGames ID

1. **Profile Integration**:
   - Display Steam username and avatar in DotsGames ID profile
   - Show Steam account level and status
   - Display Steam badges and showcases

2. **Game Library**:
   - List of owned Steam games with cover art and metadata
   - Recently played games with playtime statistics

   - Audit logging for Steam API interactions

3. **API Gateway**:
   - Proxy for Steam Web API calls
   - Rate limiting and request throttling
   - Response transformation and normalization

### Frontend Components

1. **Steam Account Linking UI**:
   - Platform selection interface
   - Authentication flow components
   - Linking status indicators

2. **Steam Profile Display**:
   - Username and avatar components
   - Account status indicators
   - Steam-specific profile sections

3. **Steam Game Library**:
   - Game list components with filtering and sorting
   - Game detail views
   - Playtime statistics visualization

4. **Steam Achievements**:
   - Achievement list and detail components
   - Progress visualization
   - Achievement comparison widgets
