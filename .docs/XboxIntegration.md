# Xbox Platform Integration - Conceptual Design

This document outlines the conceptual design for integrating the Xbox gaming platform with the DotsGames ID system. While not yet implemented, this design provides a roadmap for future development.

## Overview

The Xbox integration will allow DotsGames ID users to:

1. Link their Xbox accounts to their DotsGames ID
2. Access Xbox-specific features and data
3. Use their DotsGames ID to authenticate with Xbox services
4. View and manage their Xbox game library and achievements

## Integration Architecture

### Authentication Flow

The Xbox integration will use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for secure authentication:

1. **Initiation**:
   - User clicks "Link Xbox Account" in the DotsGames ID platform linking section
   - System redirects to the Xbox authentication page

2. **Authorization**:
   - User logs in with their Xbox credentials on the Microsoft authentication page
   - User grants permission for DotsGames ID to access their Xbox profile and data

3. **Token Exchange**:
   - Xbox authentication service returns an authorization code
   - DotsGames ID backend exchanges the code for access and refresh tokens
   - Tokens are securely stored and associated with the user's DotsGames ID

4. **Profile Linking**:
   - Xbox profile information is retrieved using the access token
   - Xbox profile is linked to the user's DotsGames ID
   - User is redirected back to the DotsGames ID platform linking page

### API Integration

The integration will utilize the Xbox Live API to access user data:

1. **Xbox Live API Endpoints**:
   - `/profile` - Retrieve user profile information
   - `/games` - Access user's game library
   - `/achievements` - Get user's achievements
   - `/friends` - Access user's friend list
   - `/presence` - Check online status and current activity

2. **Data Synchronization**:
   - Periodic background synchronization of game library and achievements
   - Real-time updates for online status and current activity
   - On-demand synchronization when user accesses specific features

### Security Considerations

1. **Token Management**:
   - Secure storage of access and refresh tokens
   - Automatic token refresh when expired
   - Token revocation on account unlinking

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Encryption of stored Xbox credentials and tokens
   - Compliance with Microsoft's data protection requirements
   - User consent for data access and storage

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Adherence to Xbox Live API rate limits
   - Caching strategies to minimize API calls
   - Graceful handling of API throttling

## User Experience

### Linking Process

1. User navigates to the Platform Linking page in DotsGames ID
2. User selects Xbox from the available platforms
3. User clicks "Link Account" button
4. User is redirected to Microsoft login page
5. User authenticates with their Xbox credentials
6. User grants permissions for DotsGames ID to access their Xbox data
7. User is redirected back to DotsGames ID with successful linking confirmation

### Xbox Features in DotsGames ID
